## Instruction
Hey there! Since you've completed Part 1 of our SQL course, you already know how to get data from a single table. You've also learnt how to filter rows to only get those which you really need. Superb!

Single tables might seem handy at first, but in big databases we always use **multiple tables**. This also means that we often want to get data from more than one table at a time. By the end of this part you'll know how to join results from multiple tables.

## Instruction
Before we start, let's explain the data sets we're going to work on.

Remember the table `car` from Part 1? We're going to use it now together with another table called `person`. We'll show you all the **examples** in this part based on these two tables.

We'll have cars (table `car`) and their owners (table `person`). We know the owner of the car because we have the column `owner_id` in the table car which contains an id from the table person. Easy, right?

Take a look at the columns the tables contain:

`person (id, name, age);`

`car (id, brand, model, price, owner_id);`

## Exercise
In case you're already fed up with the cars, we've created a new set of data for all the **exercises** in this part.

We're going to work with **movies** and their **directors**.

Open the Database tab on the right and study the tables. Think about the following question: how do we know who directed a specific movie?

When you're done, simply Next exercise and we'll tell you the answer.

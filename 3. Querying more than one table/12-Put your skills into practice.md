## Instruction
Nice! Let's put into practice everything we've learnt so far. Are you ready? This example is going to be slightly more complicated, so make sure you remember everything from this part of the course.

## Exercise
Select columns `title`, `production_year` from table `movie` and columns `name`, `birth_year` from table `director` in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director.

Show the column `birth_year` as `born_In`. Select only those movies which were filmed when their director was younger than 40 (i.e. the difference between `production_year` and `birth_year` must be lower than 40).

## Instruction
Excellent! We have one more exercise for you before the end of this part. Are you ready? You are going to write your longest SQL query ever and you'll apply knowledge from both of the parts you've mastered so far. Are you ready?

## Exercise
Select columns `id`, `title`, `production_year` from table `movie` and columns `name`, `birth_year` from table `director` in such a way that a movie is shown together with its director. Show the column `birth_year` as `born_in` and the column `production_year` as `produced_in`. Select only those movies:

whose title contains a letter 'a' and which were filmed after 2000, or
whose director was born between 1945 and 1995.

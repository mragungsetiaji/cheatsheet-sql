All right! As you can see, there are four columns in the table room: id, room_number, beds and floor.

The column

- id is the identification number of the room in our table,
- room_number is the number of the room typically found on its door in the dormitory,
- beds tells you how many beds there are in the room and
- floor is the number of the floor where the room can be found in the dormitory.
Easy!

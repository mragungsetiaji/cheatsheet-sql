## Instruction
Hi! Welcome to another part of our course. You're already pretty skillful in SQL, so this time we're going to go down into details.

By the end of this part, you'll know how to exercise real control over your JOIN clauses. Don't worry if you don't remember JOINs precisely - we're going to revise them anyway.

Before we start, you should get to know the data. We're going to work with three brand-new tables: student, room and equipment. Are you ready?

## Exercise
Let's study the first table: room. Get all the data from it.

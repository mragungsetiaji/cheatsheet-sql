## Instruction
Good. The table equipment is very much similar to the table student. It has three columns:

- id - the id of the equipment piece,
- name - which tells us what it is and
- room_id - the room where we can find the piece of equipment.
Note that some pieces aren't assigned to any room - they are simply stored in the warehouse, if you're interested.

## Instruction
Good job. Of course, count() is not the only function out there. Let's learn some others!

````sql
SELECT min(total_sum) FROM orders;
````
The function min(total_sum) returns the smallest value of the column total_sum. In this way, we can find the cheapest order in our table. Convenient, huh?

You can also use a similar function, namely max(). That's right, it returns the biggest value of the specified column. Check it for yourself.

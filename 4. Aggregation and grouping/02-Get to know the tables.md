## Instruction
Great. Let's have a look at the tables we're going to work with. If you've had enough of cars and movies already, here's a good piece of news: we're going to discuss **orders** and **employees** this time. We'll provide you with examples based on the table `orders`:

`orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, ship_date, total_sum);`

Not very complicated, as you can see.

Each order has an **id** (`order_id`), was made by a specific customer (`customer_id`) on a specific day (`order_date`) as well as shipped on a specific day (`ship_date`). The total value of the order is contained in the column `total_sum`.

## Exercise
So much for the example table.

Now take a look at the table we'll use for exercises. Here, we have **employees** with their **salaries** in specific years.

Naturally, one employee can work for more than one year, so there may be many rows for the same person, usually with different salaries each year.

The employees work in specific departments and have a certain position, which may change as the employee gets promoted.

Study the table for a moment and then Next exercise to move on.

## Instruction
Welcome to the third part of our SQL Basics course.

In the previous two parts, you've learnt how to select data from single and multiple tables. You know how to filter rows and join columns from different tables. Now it's time to move on.

In this part, you'll learn how to compute **statistics**, **group** rows and **filter** such groups. Such operations are extremely important for preparing reports and always come in handy in big tables.

Are you ready?

## Instruction
Good job! Now, apart from the equality sign (`=`), there are also some other conditional operators which you can use. Look at the next example.

> `SELECT * FROM user WHERE age < 20;`

Instead of the equality sign (`=`), we put the less than sign (`<`). Now our instruction selects only those users who are below 20. We can apply quite a few operators in the same way:

- `< (less than)`,
- `> (greater than)`,
- `<= (less than or equal)`,
- `>= (greater than or equal)`.

Easy, right? Why don't we practice it a bit?

## Exercise
Select all columns for all cars with price higher than 10 000.

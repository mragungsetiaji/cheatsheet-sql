## Instruction
Fantastic! There is one more very important conditional operator, the inequality sign (`!=` or sometimes `<>`). Look at the example:

> `SELECT * FROM user WHERE age != 18;`
See how easy it is? We've put the inequality sign (`!=`) to select all users who aren't 18.

## Exercise
Select all columns for those cars which weren't produced in 1999.

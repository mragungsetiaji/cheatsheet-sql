## Instruction
It's time to run your first SQL query! As you remember, the data in a database are stored in **tables**.

You can see all data in the user table with this query:

> `SELECT * FROM user;`

`SELECT` tells your database that you want to select data. `FROM user` tells the database to select data from the table `user`.

Finally, the asterisk (*) tells the database that you want to see **all columns** in this table.

Remember to always end your SQL command with a semicolon (;). A semicolon is like a dot at the end of the sentence. It tells the database that you're done with your command.

## Exercise
In our example database there is a table car, which contains information about a couple of cars.

Select all data from table car

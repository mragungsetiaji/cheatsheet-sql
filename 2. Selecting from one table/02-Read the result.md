## Instruction
As you can see, the table car has 5 columns:

1. `vin` (short for vehicle identification number),
2. `brand`,
3. `model`,
4. `price` and
5. `production_year`.

The names of the columns are at the top of the result.

There are 8 cars in our table: two Ford cars, one Toyota, three Volkswagens, one Fiat and one Opel. You can see that the price of a Toyota is 11 300 and the prices for Fords are 8 000 and 12 500. Note that the price for Opel is not specified - we'll explain that later.

## Exercise
Examine the result.

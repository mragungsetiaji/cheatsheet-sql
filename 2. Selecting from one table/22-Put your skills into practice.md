## Instruction
Pretty good! Now let's put together all the information we've learnt so far. Let's imagine a customer who walks in and wants to know if we have any cars that meet his needs.

## Exercise
Select all columns of those cars that:

- were produced between 1999 and 2003,
- are not Volkswagens,
- their model begins with either 'P' or 'T',
- have their price set.

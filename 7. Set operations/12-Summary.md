## Instruction
You killed it, wonderful!

Looks like we're done and you've learnt all there was to learn in this SQL basics course. By now, you should know pretty much: how to deal with single and multiple tables, how to filter results, how to compute statistics, JOIN tables and results - you can now write amazing queries all by yourself!

Or can you? We've prepared a revision part for you where you can check your combined skills and knowledge from all the parts of the course. Revise everything and give it a shot!

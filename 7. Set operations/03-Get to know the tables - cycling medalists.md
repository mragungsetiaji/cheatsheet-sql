## Instruction
Great, let's find out what we have in there. As you can see, the table contains the following columns:

- id which is the identification number for each medal,
- person which is the first and last name of the person who won the medal,
- country which the person represented,
- year when the medal was won,
- place which indicates the kind of medal (1 - gold, 2 - silver, 3 - bronze).

There are of course various categories of cycling, but to make things easier, we don't care about them here. We've just picked some sportsmen and sportwomen and put their medals in the table, not too many so that you can get the hang of the table quickly.

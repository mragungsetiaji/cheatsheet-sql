## Instruction
Okay, how does the magic work? How can we show two tables as one?

As you probably expect, both tables must have the same number of columns so that the results can be merged into one table. Makes sense, right? You should also remember that the respective columns must have the same kind of information: number or text.

If one of your tables puts numbers in the column place (1, 2, 3) and the other puts texts ('first', 'second', 'third'), the trick won't work.

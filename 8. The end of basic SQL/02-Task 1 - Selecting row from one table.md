## Instruction
Great. How superstitious are you? We're going to deal with... horoscopes! Check out the table:

`horoscope (id, year, sign, content)`

Let's describe the table a little bit. In the table, we have horoscopes for given years - they are sentences that describe what may or will happen in the specific year.

Each horoscope has an id, refers to a specific year and a specific zodiac sign. The column content contains the magical sentence.

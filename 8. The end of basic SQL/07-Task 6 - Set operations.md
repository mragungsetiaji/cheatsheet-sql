## Instruction
Unbelievable! How about set operations: unions, differences and intersections? Can you still remember them? Take a look:

`gluten_free_product (id, type, name, calories, price)`

`vegetarian_product (id, type, name, calories, price)`

As you can see, we are now inside a dietician's office. We have two tables with the same columns: products that are free of gluten and vegetarian products. Each product has its own id, its type (whether it's meat, dairy etc.), name, number of calories per portion and price.

----
## Exercise
Show all columns for the products which are gluten free and vegetarian at the same time.

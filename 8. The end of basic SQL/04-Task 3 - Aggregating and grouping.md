## Instruction
A-ma-zing! Part 2 was no challenge for you! Take a look at our third task:

`essay (id, person, topic, length, points)`

We're now going to analyze essays written by various students. Each essay has an id, was written by a specific person, has a certain topic and certain length (expressed as the number of words). Each essay is given points (0-100).

There may be more than one essay written by the same person.

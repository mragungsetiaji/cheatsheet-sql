## Instruction
Okay! Complex instructions require complex examples. Let's imagine a travel agency and its database. We're going to work with as many as 5 tables this time: country, city, mountain, trip and hiking_trip. Let's analyze them. Use the Database button on the right to see the contents of each table discussed.

Let's start with the table country.

As you can see, there are different countries listed in the table country. The travel agency operates in all of them, so we need some basic info in the table: the id of the country, the name of the country, its population and the area in square kilometers.

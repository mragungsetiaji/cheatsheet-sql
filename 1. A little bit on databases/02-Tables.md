## Instructions

Every relational database stores information in **tables**. You can have many tables in one database and each of your tables will keep data which refers to similar objects. Each table has a **name** so you can find out what kind of information is stored there.

For example, the database of your university would include a table named `student` with all data regarding students, another table `subject` with information on the subjects at your university, etc.

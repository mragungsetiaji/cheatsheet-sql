## Instruction
In our SQL Basics course, we'll often show you tables and describe them a little bit before we start using them. To do this, we'll use the following notation:

`pet (id, name, owner_id)`

The above means that we have a table named `pet` which has the following columns: `id`, `name` and `owner_id`. This information will be enough for you to work with the tables in our exercises.

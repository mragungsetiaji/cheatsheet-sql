## Instruction
Tables in databases look exactly the way you would imagine a normal table - they have **columns** and **rows**.

Columns in every table have their **names** and they describe what kind of information is stored in them.

Each row stores information about one object. In the student table below, you can see that the column names reflect the kind of data contained in them, so in the column `name` there are names of students, in the column `graduation_year` there are their years of graduation, etc.

Each **row** corresponds to exactly one student.

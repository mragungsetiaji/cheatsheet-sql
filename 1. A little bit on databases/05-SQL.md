## Instruction
So, how do we get in touch with our database? We use the so-called **Structured Query Language**. Of course, no one uses the full name, we just call it **SQL** for short.

All relational databases understand SQL, but each of them has a slightly different dialect, so to speak.

In this time, you will learn the **basics of the standard SQL** which will be understood by every relational database. Thanks to SQL, you'll be able to make queries in each database environment.

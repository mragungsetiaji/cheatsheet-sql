## Instruction
The instructions that we'll learn in this course are called **queries**. Just as the name suggests, queries are questions that we ask to find out some information about the data stored in the database.

Databases can do amazing things - they don't only return the data you ask for, they can actually do advanced calculations on the tables. You'll see for yourself!

We'll start with very simple instructions and we'll introduce new things one by one. By the end of this course, you'll be able to write fairly complex queries.

So, are you ready for Part 1? See you there and have your fingers ready for typing!
